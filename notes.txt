50Maint:
page 173: roller descriptions, explains many registers
p14: index to CAS logic diagrams.
p21: E->SCANCTL sets 2's complement of SDR into sequence counter indicators
p22: HA->A microorder selects main storage.
p28: ROS debug kernels
SCAN*E,00 sets FLT register, used with general purpose stats
p32: EMIT 1000 + E->SCANCTL sets SS (supervisory stat) to SDR(6), SESS to SDR(4)
STD=0 branches on and increments scan test counter.
Pass/Fail triggers set by E->SCANCTL with EMIT 0001, reset by E->SCANCTL + EMIT 0101
pass trigger test and branch: SCPS
fail trigger test and branch: SCFS
FLT: fault location test
p158: discusses IPL theory

Power-on reset forces to 242: QU100, 50Maint p183
IPL: starts at 240: QU100
IPL: S3=1, MD=3
Flow chart on 50Maint page 186
PSW restart at 2c2: S3=1, MD=0

LS addressing:
Emit(2-3) to SLFR, R(24-27) to J
Bump addressing:
R to mover U, W(0,1) to SAR 14-15, Emit(2-3) to SAR 16-17, W(2-7) to SAR 24-29
